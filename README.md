# Java-Examples-
Examples of Multithread, Exception handling

The used Questions are:

10. Write a java class which consists of 5 integer data. Overload constructor (Default &     normal) to initialize those integer data members. Provide a method which sorts those integer data members using bubble sort.
11. Write a program to maintain the office database using single inheritance. Superclass  is Employee that  
       contain the information as follows- Emp_code, Emp_name,   Address, Ph_no,  Da-10%, Hra-20%. 
       The inheritance properties held by the problem is as follows:--

    Teaching class contains attribute subject specialization, designation and Office class contains  
    attribute designation. Create all the lowest level classes each class having their own basic pay. 
           Implement the inheritance concept of above figure and calculate the salary statement for each  
           employee.

12. Create a package called “Shape”. Inside this package define a class named as “Figure”, which computes the volume of a cube, cylinder and rectangular box using method overloading. 
       Access the class and methods from another file.

13. Write a program using an interface called Volume. Assume that there is a part in a machine having   
       three  dimension s1,s2,s3 and
       Involume=1/3*pi*s1*s2*s3
       Outvolume=4/3* pi*s1*s2*s3

14. Define an Exception “NoMatchFoundException” that is thrown when “Kolkata” is  not found from  
       the following set of strings.
city name ={ Kolkata, Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Amedabad}

15. Write a program to handle “divide by zero exception” with the following message in finally block  
      “Exception occurred” if the quotient is -1 otherwise print the result in finally block  (set quotient  
       initially with -1 as default).

16. Write a program to declare & instantiate an 2D-array to hold marks obtained by students in different 
       subjects in a class. Assume that there are up to 10 students in a class & there are 5 subjects. Find out 
       the best student according to average marks of all subjects and display all the marks of him/her.

17. Write a program in which 3 threads should run and set them different priorities.
18. Write a program in multithreading where one thread is Fibonacci and another thread is Prime.       Fibonacci thread will display the Fibonacci series for n terms with 1000 ms sleeping time, whereas the Prime thread will print all prime numbers of a given range with 500 ms sleeping time.
